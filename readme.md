pageturn
========

This is a simple shim program I wrote in order to use my surface as a digital music stand.
It runs in the background and translates screen taps into key presses for the desired program, in this case SumatraPDF.
More specifically, taps on the bottom left (right) quadrant of the screen send a left (resp. right) arrow key to SumatraPDF. 
Compiles in Visual Studio and for best results, enable the DPI awareness flag.
